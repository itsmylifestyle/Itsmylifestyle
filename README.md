First of all - Welcome! I’m a nice fun and friendly person, I’m honest and punctual, I work well in a team but also on my own as I like to set myself goals which I will achieve, I have good listening and communication skills. I have a creative mind and am always up for new challenges. I am well organized and always plan ahead to make sure I manage my time well.
Also I'm a software engineer and I'm glad that you've come to my GitHub. Don't be shy to ask me whatever you want :)
